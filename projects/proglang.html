                            This was a programming assignment I created as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for 
                            Programming Language in Fall 2021 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The assignment
                            was inspired by the BitTorrent protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing. It was greatly
                            simplified as a lot of students potentially did not have a lot of exposure to distributed
                            computing and because it was in a language that was new to most students (either Erlang or SALSA).
                            I came up with this programming assignment with one other TA who wrote up starter code and an
                            auto-grader for SALSA while I wrote starter code and an auto-grader for Erlang (students had the
                            option to complete the assignment in either Erlang or SALSA). I was also new to Erlang at the
                            start of the course so it was an interesting challenge to learn this new language plus the
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model</a> and create an interesting
                            programming assignment.

                            The assignment tasks students to create code for a directory service and file servers. The
                            directory service keeps track of the fiels located in file servers. Clients interact with the
                            directory service to upload files, which the directory service breaks into chunks and distributes
                            them among the connected file servers. Clients can also request files from the directory service.
                            The connected file servers act as peers for the client and send chunks to the client which reconstructs
                            the full file. More information is given in the pdf linked below.

                            As this was created for a class, only the starter code and assignment pdf are hosted here.
                            My implementation of the assignment is not included.
