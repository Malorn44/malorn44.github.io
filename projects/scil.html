                        <p>
                            SCIL was the first major project I worked on as part of
                            the <a href="https://lacailab.cogsci.rpi.edu/">LACAI Lab</a>. The goal of SCIL was to
                            identify social roles of individuals within dialogues (such as Leader, Influencer) by
                            analyzing the language used by those individuals (the frequency of certain words, how
                            many words a speaker introduced into the conversation, how speakers influenced the
                            topics of conversation, etc...). SCIL was initially an IARPA project in the late 2000s
                            and early 2010s. Since then, a lot of advancement had been made in Natural Language
                            Processing and Computational Sociolinguistics. The project was initially implemented in
                            Java, so my task was to re-implement SCIL in python as that had become the main language
                            for NLP research.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I chose to re-implement SCIL as a python package to increase the ease of use and to
                            increase the modularity of the toolkit. My main goals were to create an implementation
                            that provided results that were at least as good as the original while also vastly
                            increasing the speed of the program and increasing its functionality. I was able to
                            achieve these goals, adding several new metrics it can calculate, vastly increasing
                            the speed of the toolkit (metrics that took minutes to compute now took seconds), and
                            achieving performance that was as good as the original implementation (on shared metrics).
                            A description of these metrics can be found in the PyPI and Github pages linked below.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to the toolkit, I also worked on an auto-tagger model for identifying metaTags
                            of turns in dialogues with a fellow lab member. We achieved moderate success, creating a model
                            that did produce the correct metaTags significantly better than random and was sufficient enough,
                            in most cases, to produce accurate results with SCIL. As a note, metaTags were required by some metrics
                            but were rarely the only determining component of those metrics, so even if the tags weren't fully
                            accurate, the metric wasn't necessarily that innacurate. The main hinderence to the development
                            of this model was a lack of ground-truth training data. Links to the tagger can also be found below.
